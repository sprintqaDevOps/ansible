Dynamic Inventory documentation:      https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#inventory-script-example-aws-ec2 
pip installation documentation:       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install-linux.html


1. Download ec2.py and ec2.ini files to your ansible location.

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/stable-2.8/contrib/inventory/ec2.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/stable-2.8/contrib/inventory/ec2.ini
chmod +x ec2.py

2. Ensure you have pip installed
pip --version 
python --version

3. Download pip installation package 
cd
curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/2.7/get-pip.py
ls
python get-pip.py
pip --version

4. Add pip installation to your path
ll -a
echo $SHELL
echo $PATH
export PATH=/home/ansibleadmin/.local/bin:$PATH
echo $PATH
source ~/get-pip.py
pip --version

5. install boto
pip install boto

6. run python ec2.py script
./ec2.py

7. Add iam role to your ansible engine with full EC2 permissions

8. run python script again
./ec2.py

9. set elasticache = False in ec2.ini file

10. run python script and now you can see everything from your account. 

11. confirm that you can ping all ec2s from your aws account with ansible cli 
ansible -i ec2.py ec2 -m ping

12. Create another ec2 with amazon linux 2 ami and wait till it is running. 

13. Now, try to ping all ec2s including the new one. It will give you permission denied error for the newly added ec2. 

14. Create ami from client nodes and now create a new EC2 using this ami.

15. test ansible ping again. now you should be able to ping all ec2s including the new one. 

16. add Environment:web to node1 and node2 clients, and Environment:db to node3 client.

17. Use python script to build your custom inventory from dynamic inventory you get from ansible cli. 

18. check python location:  which python 

19. create python script on VS Code.
